# Notebook Instructions

These homework noteboooks use Julia. They require a Julia 1.7.x kernel as well as an environment that includes the following dependencies:
- LinearAlgebra
- Optim
- LineSearches

These notebooks copy all relevant source code in order to display the algorithm implementations, so they do not need to be run alongside the rest of the code in the [package](https://github.com/camirmas/DesignAutomation).
