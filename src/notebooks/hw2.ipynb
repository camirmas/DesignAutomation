    "h(n) does reach zero when the goal is met. The heuristic is _weakly_ monotonically decreasing due to h(n) remaining at the same value for some iterations. It is difficult to determine if the heuristic is admissible without keeping track of the path of the tree. With that information, however, we can analyze the results similar to Figure 9-19 from the text. One strategy is to have each child keep track of its parents, and to trace the path from the goal node back to the seed, collecting all associated values and observing them graphically. In such a case, even if we find that the heuristic is not admissible (objective function is not strictly monotonic), we would likely still find that our approach reaches optimal solutions. If we did, however, see a concerning trend in the objective function, we could apply the \"path-max\" approach to force the objective function to be, at worst, weakly monotonic. In terms of units, we did not put any weights on g(n) and h(n), hence both are integer values, though we suspect we would have found improved solutions with a weighting approach favoring the heuristic, particularly for the more complicated cases, E and F. This would not be without its tradeoffs, as emphasizing the heuristic leads to a more greedy algorithm."

    "Overall, A* performed much faster than depth first search and was able to find solutions for all of the problems under 20 minutes. For some of the more complex problems, we increased the max depth of the tree to find a solution. Interestingly, while the algorithm finds solutions without the use of a max depth parameter (indicating completeness), when no max depth was supplied, we occasionally saw a worse solution result (i.e. case C, where the seed has a walkway in the very middle of the grid). \n",

    "Space and time limitations are intrinsic to the performance of A* algorithms. We've seen through this exercise that, even for relatively small problems, the exponential nature of worst-case space and time complexity plays a large role in performance. Given that problems like this one do not scale well, we can consider other algorithms that reduce space and time constraints at the cost of completeness and optimality guarantees. For example, if we know our space limit and the problem has a small branching factor, it could be benefical to use a Beam Search method. Beam search uses linear time and space, and works well for deep trees. This will result in a more practical solution at the possible expense of finding the optimal solution. "
